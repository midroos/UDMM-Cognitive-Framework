# UDMM Cognitive Framework

A comprehensive cognitive framework based on the Unified Dynamic Model of Mind (UDMM), designed to simulate perception, intention, and prediction in an evolving world. This repository includes conceptual models, mathematical formulations, and potential applications in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences.

## Overview

The UDMM (Unified Dynamic Model of Mind) presents a unified structure for understanding cognition as a dynamic, predictive, and interaction-based process. It simulates the mind as a generative model constantly synchronizing with sensory input, minimizing informational divergence, and adjusting its internal representations through prediction error.

Key concepts:
- **Virtual Attractor**: The implicit goal state the system tends toward.
- **Saturated World**: The richly inferred representation of the world shaped by intent and past interaction.
- **KL Divergence**: Used to measure mismatch between expected and received input.

## Structure

This repository includes:
- `model/`: core components and diagrams of the UDMM
- `math/`: draft equations for active inference and divergence reduction
- `papers/`: published papers and whitepapers on UDMM
- `examples/`: simulated scenarios using simplified agents
- `docs/`: explanatory documents and extended discussions
