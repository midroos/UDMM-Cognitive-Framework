UDMM-Cognitive-Framework
A software framework to implement and test the Unified Dynamic Memory Model (UDMM), which integrates Reinforcement Learning with Long-Term Memory systems.
This project aims to demonstrate that incorporating cognitive memory can significantly improve an agent's efficiency in solving complex tasks.
Key Features
 * UDMM Agent: An AI agent based on Q-learning with an optional memory system (full_ltm vs no_ltm configurations).
 * Comprehensive Memory System: Consists of:
   * Episodic Memory: Records experiences (states, actions, rewards) with a priority mechanism.
   * Semantic Memory: Builds "schemas" from high-priority experiences to provide fast, inferential guidance.
 * Enhanced Learning Mechanisms:
   * Prioritized Replay: Targeted replay of important experiences.
   * Decision Gating: A "gate" mechanism to ensure the semantic memory provides only reliable advice.
   * Schema Hygiene: Builds intelligent schemas based on cumulative returns instead of immediate rewards.
 * Test Environment: trap_env, an 8x8 grid environment specifically designed to test the agent's ability to avoid fixed traps.
 * Experimental Framework: run.py, a script to manage experiments, log data, and analyze performance.
How to Run
To reproduce the results, follow these steps:
 * Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UDMM-Cognitive-Framework.git
cd UDMM-Cognitive-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt # Ensure numpy, pandas, and matplotlib are included

 * Run the Experiments:
   Run both the LTM-enabled agent and the baseline agent (no_ltm).
   # Run the agent with long-term memory
python run.py --env trap --config full_ltm --episodes 200 --seed 42 --run_name "full_ltm_exp"

# Run the baseline agent (without memory)
python run.py --env trap --config no_ltm --episodes 200 --seed 42 --run_name "no_ltm_exp"

   Performance results will be stored in the runs/ directory.
Final Results
Experiments showed that the enhanced UDMM agent clearly outperforms the baseline agent in the trap_env.
| Metric | full_ltm (Enhanced) | no_ltm (Baseline) |
|---|---|---|
| Success Rate (%) | 100.00% | 100.00% |
| Avg. Reward | 8.20 | 6.59 |
| Avg. Steps (Overall) | 19.05 | 35.08 |
Results Summary:
Thanks to "Decision Gating" and "Schema Hygiene," the LTM agent became significantly more efficient, learning optimal paths in far fewer steps. Diagnostic metrics confirmed that the memory system was active and reliable:
 * Schema Usage Rate: 99.33%
 * Avg. Bias Confidence: 0.98
 * Avg. Q-Value Delta: +0.28
These numbers confirm that the semantic memory provided accurate guidance that enhanced the agent's decisions, proving the success of the UDMM framework.
